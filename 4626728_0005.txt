This reei of microfiim contains materiei
which hes peper coior changes steine, or
illustratione (some of which may appear on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure thet eii text enci illustratione ere

Therefore‚ when text end illustratione exist
in e single image or when materiei
becquounds differ, such tremes may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reflecte the camere
operator’s best effert to capture the majority
of the text; the second exposure reflecte trie

cernere operator’s best estort to capture
iliustretive materiei or the remaining] text. it

is hoped thet this practice wiii result in e
microfiirn product thet fuiiy serves the needs

of most reseerchers.
